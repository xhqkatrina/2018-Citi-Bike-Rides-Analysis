# 2018 Citi Bike Rides Analysis

## Introduction
Like all the sharing systems we know, Airbnb, Uber etc., the Citi Bike is also a sharing system which is the network of bicycle rental stations intended for point-to-point transportation. The Citi Bike is also the largest bike sharing system in NYC, with 12000 bikes and 750 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Itâ€™s a fast, healthy, sustainable and highly popular way to get around NYC.

In our project, we will mainly focus on two parts about Citi Bike Dataset. For the first part, we will focus on the general analysis about this dataset, including the analysis of Age, Gender, Usertype, the most popular routes or stations etc. In addition to analysis about the data, we will come up some recommendations based on the findings which we explore from the plots. For the second part, we will focus on and interactive visualization. Our shiny app shows more details about some of the questions we analyzed on the first part, displaying more geographical information and providing new insights.
